Collection of examples for information flow security in the presence of unverified code.

### Leaking Objects to Unverified Code
The 6 cases of leaking objects (i.e. passing them to unverified code) based on Frederic Neckers Master thesis<sup>1</sup> and expanded:


1. A reference to the object is **returned by a method that unverified code called**
2. A reference to the object is **assigned to the public field of an unverified object**
3. A reference to the object is **assigned to the public field of a leaked object**
4. A reference to the object is **passed as the argument to a method of an unverified object**
5. A reference to the object is **indirectly passed** by being in a public field of another object when this other object is itself passed to the unverified code
6. A reference to the object is **returned by an unverified method**
